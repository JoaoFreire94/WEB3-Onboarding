# WEB3-Onboarding

This repository is divided into frontend and backend. Each of the folders has a different package.json so you need to run the yarn command individually in each folder.
On the Server folder if you don't have nodemon you should run command yarn global add nodemon.

To start the project it is necessary to run the yarn start command on the backend and then run the yarn start command on the frontend and it is ready to be tested.
